    <p>
      I'm software engineer working on full stack by day and curious software hacker by night.
    </p>
    <p>
      My professional interest lies around distributed systems, artificial intelligence and machine learning, software automation and developer tools.
      Also, I'm excited about programming languages, high performance computing, IoT and electronics.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm open to team management and business development and entrepreneurship.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love working on company products, not on made-to-order things in small companies.
      I like lean, modern, fast evolving,  bleeding-edge technologies and tools, not those heavy and boring enterprise toolkits.
