          Hi, I'm Eugene Sypachev. I started my path in IT when I was 15, was caught by passion of creation and never looked back. 
          Since then, I've been testing software, building software, leading teams, contributing to open source and building companies.
        </p>

        <p>
          Being naturally curious person, I have never focused on one technology or programming language. 
          I have strong preference of working on a full stack, from the ground of infrastructure and DevOps practices to the hights of front-end and user experience. 
          Perhaps, I worked with JVM stack, Go, Ruby and Node.js the most.
        </p>

        <p>
          The desire to go deep in all areas of study, combined with a passion for adventure, and fortune of working with very knowledgeable and experienced people, 
          allowed me to feel great in wast range of roles from startups to enterprise companies.
          Nevertheless, I prefer chaotic atmosphere of startups.
        </p>

        <p>
          Recreationally, I'm passionate about skiing, fly-fishing, food, and traveling.
        </p>

        <p>
          I started skiing when I was 14 years old, and have had the opportunity to enjoy some of the best Ski Country in the world, 
          from Bad Gastein in Austria to GrandValira in Andorra, still being eager to explore American continents.
        </p>

        <p>
          Fly-fishing became another life-long enjoyment originating in the calm evenings on the coasts of rivers with my father. 
          I was drawn to the challenge and creativity of self-made lures.
        </p>

        <p>
          My most recent passion is traveling and gastronomical experiences. 
          The desire to find and eat delicious food around the world, accompanied by good wine, is something that my wife and I enjoy the most together.
        </p>

        <p>
          When at home, you can find me exploring the magic of electronics, excitement of e-sports, or reading good sci-fi or fiction books.
