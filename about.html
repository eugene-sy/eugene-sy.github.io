	<p>
	  I'm software engineer working on full stack by day and curious software hacker by night.
	</p>
	<p>
	  My professional interest lies in the area of distributed systems, software automation and developer tools.
	  Also, I'm excited about programming languages, artificial intelligence and machine learning, high performance computing, IoT and electronics.
	</p>
	<p>
	  I'm open to team management and business development and entrepreneurship.
	</p>
	<p>
	  I love working on company products, not on made-to-order things in small companies.
	  I like lean, modern, fast evolving,  bleeding-edge technologies and tools, not those heavy and boring enterprise toolkits.
