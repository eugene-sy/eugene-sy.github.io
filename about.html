    <p>
      I'm Java/Scala full stack software developer by day and curious software hacker by night.
    </p>
    <p>
      My interests are programming languages (mostly functional), automation, developer tools, UI and UX, artificial intelligence and machine learning, business and entrepreneurship.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love working on company products, not on made-to-order things. I like lean, modern, bleeding-edge technologies and tools, not those heavy and boring enterprise toolkits.
