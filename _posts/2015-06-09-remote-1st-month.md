A month ago I have quit my 9-to-5 in-office job and now I work in a startup as a remote software developer. This article describes my experience and challenges in the last month.

## Challenge #1: Time zones

The team is distibuted around the world. Most team members are in USA and Mexica, there are some in Australia... It's a 10 hour difference between me and core team in San-Francisco. It is practically impossible to work the same hours as a core team does.

Now, my work day is divided in two parts: the evening time, when I can chat with other team members and pair on tasks and other one, when I'm almost alone.
Both parts are about 4 hours long. It takes some time to get used to this rithm, but then you get an advantage of this division. It's really very important to have a time when noone tries to disturb you and you can concentrate on task. I have never achieved that in the office. On the other side when you are stuck on task there is noone who can help, to solve this I just put a task on hold and start the other. 

## Challenge #2: Language

I have never been confident in my level of English. I always tried to duck out of conversations with foreign people if I could. It's something in the level of subconscious, when you get older you start to fear to use other languages.

I cannot say that now I made away with that fear. I just try to stop thinking about possible mistakes and misunderstanding. I'm just speaking and writing, asking nearby people to correct me if I'm wrong.
