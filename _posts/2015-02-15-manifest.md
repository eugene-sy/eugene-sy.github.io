Hello, Reader!

I'm passionate software developer currently living in Russia, St.Petersburg. I'm working on web applications in Scala and Ruby most of the time.

Today, I'm starting this blog. I'll try to share my knowlage and thoughts on software development, programming languages and paradigms, technologies and my experience with them. Also, I'd like to write some book reviews. I hope it would be interesting for you!

Also, I have some aims that I'd like to achieve starting this blog (and it's the second reason I'm writing now):

* I'd like to improve my writing skills and English;
* I'd like to contribute more to opensource community;
* I'd like to become more 'public' person.

Thank you!
