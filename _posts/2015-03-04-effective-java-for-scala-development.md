I have avoided reading 'classical' developer literature for years. I thought

But now, my curiosity has got the better and I took the _"Effective Java (2nd Edition)"_ by Joshua Bloch [\[1\]](#1). I can say that my assumptions were wrong, 'classical' reading can be interesting and helpful if read carefully.

Lets discuss this book from position of Scala developer.
