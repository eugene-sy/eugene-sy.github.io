Half a year ago I finally changed my main text editor to Emacs. It was a long journey, full of adventures and discoveries.

## The Steps Taken

As I already said it was a long journey.

My first experience with code editing I received long ago in the text editor if Xcode. I don't really remember it, I just started to learn how to code, I was doing exercises from Apple Developer Portal on MacOS development at the early days of MacOS X. The 10-12 years old boy tried his typed words into text field, pressed 'Build' button, looked into console output and tried to decrypt alien symbols of compiler error. The only thing from that times I carried through the years is the love of colors and fancy conde highlighting (except curiosity, of course).

The next stop for me was TextMate. We had Fortran course in the university. We used some sort of IDE on windows machines, but at home I had Mac. TextMate became my best friend, while I was learning how to compile proggrams using command line `gfortran`. At the time I realised that a thing that compiles and works on Mac could fail on Windows, so my friend and I decided about checking my code on his Windows machine too. I wrote code, sent it to the friend of mine, he compiled it and sent errors back if any. Code highlighting was really usefull again.

A year later (it was 2007-2008), my beloved Mac died. I tried to repair it, but unsuccessfully. At the time I had to do quite a lot of chores for math and physics, which included a lot of repeating tasks, and I was curious about using programming to solve problems of physics (we, naive students, had not been told that they use computers successfully to do so for years). I had no choise but to buy PC laptop. This brought me to the land of frustration and anger. Every single thing that I tried was bad, inresponsive, ugly,... I tried a lot of things. There were Visual Studio, Eclipse, Notepad++, a bunch of other things on Windows. I tried to live with Linux, but it was almost unusable for my studies (we had custom software for homeworks, that was not built for Linux and could not be run on it even with Wine). Fortunately, VisualStudio 2008 and then 2010 happened and I found enough perservance to set up Notepad++. That time I played with C/C++ and Fortran for the university tasks and tried to dive into the land of web with Ruby, JavaScript and C# (Ruby on Windows? huh...).

Next stop of my journey was in the lands of Java. I started working as a Software Test Engineer in an enterprise company, that was writing software on IBM platform. Part of my job was to automate testing. I was introduced to IntelliJ products and I worked with Eclipse too due to policy restrictions of our customers. Also that period of my life taught me sone vi/vim (and yes, I closed it by killing it from another session or terminating ssh access several times before I learned about modes and key sequencies).

I changed job, but IntelliJ IDEA was still with me. I believe it still is the best IDE for Java. Then the language changed from Java to Scala. Fortunately, IDEA already had a plugin for Scala, so I had not change my tool. I had two instances of IDEA installed for the case if Scala plugin breaks, but it was ok.

While doing heavy Java/Scala coding in IDEA, I used Sublime Text for JavaScript/Ruby/other thing. The feel of using Sublime was very pleasurable. Multiline editing, formatting, code highlighting, plugins and ability to customize were so good.

After some time of happy coding, I saw a post that GitHub would release Atom. The product of GitHub could not be bad, could it? So, I gave it a try. After several month of usage, when the euphoria of GitHub product usage weathered, I realised that it is slower than Sublime and it cannot handle large files (database dump editing? no chance). I switched back to Sublime.

I also tried VSCode recently, but it was not so good to consider switching from Sublime.
